    "Each timestamp found in the file is associated to a prediction: 1 when an anomaly is detected an 0 otherwise. When the `prediction` field is 1 (an anomaly is detected), the `diagnostics` field contains each sensor (with the format `component`\\\\`tag`) and an associated percentage. This percentage corresponds to the magnitude of impact of a given sensor to the detected anomaly. For instance, in the example above, the tag `signal-067` located on the `subsystem-19` component has an estimated 12% magnitude of impact to the anomaly detected at 8pm on April 7th 2021. This dataset has 122 sensors: if each sensor contributed the same way to this event, the impact of each of them would be `100 / 122 = 0.82%`, so 12% is indeed statistically significant."
